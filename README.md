# SysIdFreq
System identification in frequency domain

We will implement the exercises in the two books of Schoukens to help unterstanding the key ideas of identification in frequency domain.

Questions: 
- which estimator should we use?
- how should we design the experiment?
- what is the best approximation of nonlinear systems in frequency domain?
- how to connect the field of SysId and robust control?
